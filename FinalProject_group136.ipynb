    "The NFL season usually starts in September and ends in February. Across the 17-week regular season and the playoffs afterwards, weather conditions at a team’s home stadium could change substantially. Furthermore, teams not only play at their home stadiums, but also have to travel to other regions in the country, possibly with very different climate, to play away games. Therefore, it is expected that teams will play under different weather conditions throughout the season. Knowing the relationship between team performance and weather conditions will be useful to NFL teams so that they may adopt different strategies under different weather conditions and hold special training sessions before playing at their least favorite weather conditions.  \n"
